Introducing zones for interfaces
--------------------------------

Setting cellZones according to named surfaces:
Surface : rotatingZone
    faceZones : 1(rotatingZone)
    cellZone  : rotatingZone

Setting cellZones according to locationsInMesh:
Location : (0 0 0.01)
    cellZone : none

For cellZone none found point (0 0 0.01) in global region 0 out of 1 regions.
Found 1 closed, named surfaces. Assigning cells in/outside these surfaces to the corresponding cellZone.

Walking from known cellZones; crossing a faceZone face changes cellZone

Only keeping zone faces inbetween different cellZones.
